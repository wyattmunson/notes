= Rego

== Rego Examples

99% of Rego statements are if conditions. 

[source,rego]
----
allow {
    input.method == "GET"
}
----

Rego statements can be combined in a single policy.

[source,rego]
----
allow {
    input.method == "GET"
}

// OR operator between rules
allow {
    // AND operator within statements
    input.method == "PATCH"
    input.user.isAdmin == true
}

allow {
    not input.user.email == "robin@harness.io"
}
----

There is no need for explicit ANDs or ORs: 

* The statements within the allow block are ANDed together
* Use multiple rules for the OR operator
* There is an explicity NOT operator

### Collaboration and Packages

Every policy in OPA is scoped to a package name. This is defined by the writer of the policy. Policies can be written to consume other packages. 

Each team can create its own packages (`package secops`, `package developers`).
