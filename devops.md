What is it. Who does it? And how much do they get paid for it.

## Software release cycle

The various stages a software product progresses through on its way to be shipped to customers. The term "beta version" is a common term that refers to one of the phases of the release cycle.

**Pre-Alpha**

General term for all software development work (as well as design and planning) that occurs before the formal testing processes has begun. All work performed before an alpha release is considered pre-alpha: requirements gather and analysis, designing, development work, and unit testing of the code by the developer who wrote it.

In this pre-alpha stage, the software is being tagged with a release, likely linked to milestones that deliver feature or otherwise satisfy requirements.

**Alpha**

This is the phase of the software release cycle where testing begins. Testing using white-box testing techniques and progressing to black-box and grey-box testing. At this point the software can contain significant bugs resulting in crashed apps or data loss, and be feature incomplete.

In the open source space alpha release are almost always publically available, while closed source software is rarely externally available during its alpha phase.

**Beta**

At this point the software is feature complete, but contains bugs, some of which may not have surfaced yet. The software has been assesed from many angles internally: multiple rounds of usability studies, integration testing, and the like, it's time to put the software in the hands of users to find the gaps the designers didn't foresee.

To drive help drive the product to completion, the software is release to specific set of users to flush out any remaning bugs, validate usability, and measure performance in a production like setting.

Gone are the days when a company could ideate on a product internally for six years before releasing to the public. Worse, spending six years on a product that fails because of some fatal, obvious-in-hindsight flaw can be catastrophic to a company. Today, the goal is to ship you products as fast as possible. An inferior product that beats a superior product to market wins the day.

- Open beta - software is released for open use to the public. Early adopters help identify the bugs that surface when the software is being used in a production-like environment.
- Closed beta - used in an application where the vendor wants more control over what users have access.

**Release Candidate**

Ready to go. A release designated a release candidate can potentially be the final product. All development work at this point is fixing bugs, of which should be few and minor. No deal breaking bugs at this point. A release is called "code complete" when developers agree no further code will be added.

### Release

**Release to Manufacturing**

At this point the software developement is done. In the old days, release to manufacturing entailed sending the software to factories to have physical, productized versions of the software.

**General Availability**

The software is available for purchase by the end users. Availability on all regions may not happen on the same day as localization and compliance activities must occur.

### Maintenance

**End of Life**

Vendor's announcement that a software product has reached its end of life and will may not be supported by the vendor. The level of support varies between vendors and the type of product. When a version of Windows reach EoL, Microsoft continues to provide support by way of security updates for years after.
